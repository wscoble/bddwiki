#  BDD Wiki
## A wiki based testing project for [behat](http://behat.org).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wscoble/bddwiki.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wscoble/bddwiki)

Behavior driven development (BDD) works well with many businesses and projects.  [Behat](http://behat.org) is a popular
BDD framework for PHP, is easy to configure, and is easy to use.  However, executing tests stored outside the normal
features file structure is rather difficult.

I like [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org) as a wiki based testing platform, but it's Java, not PHP based.  I like
[Moztrap](http://moztrap.mozilla.org), but it doesn't play well with Gherkin syntax; it does have a great API though.

So what would happen if the two combined with Behat and PHP?  BDD Wiki would happen, of course.

BDD Wiki is in its infancy, but I'll be working on it as I can and hope that you can contribute.  Please make sure
your pull requests have solid tests associated with them; this is a testing product, after all!
